        <h1>History</h1>
            
        <h2>Ancient Egypt</h2>
        <p>As interior design has <em>evolved</em> around the course of time, evidence has been found that civilization back thousands of years ago incorporated it into their culture. Although it is not the same, they used things such as paintings, pottery and wall art to decorate caves. Some common materials people would use for painting were charcoal and limonite. Every civilization had a different style of design and arteticture depending on their culture. For the egyptions, the often used yellow to paint their walls to show a relation to the sun. Some other aspects shown within their design were flower paintings, handcarved furniture, utensils, and pots.<a href="https://www.dsigndpo.com/blog/history-of-interior-design/#:~:text=The%20ceilings%20or%20roof%20was,the%20colour%20of%20the%20sun" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SOURCE</a></p>
            
        <h2>Ancient Greece</h2>
        <p>Ancient Greek architecture and design was looked at as either wealthy or lower class. Some popular things at the time were white simplistic walls. The Greeks didn’t believe in tons of design and furniture as they didn’t like their homes to feel cluttery. They often referred to their motto which is <em>“less is more.”</em> They would incorporate a few wall hanging decorations, but nothing too much. Their walls usually consisted of <em>“sun dried clay bricks,”</em> which were painted after. As for their floors, the Greeks decorated them with colored pebbles in hopes to create a mosaic effect. <a href="https://www.metropolitanme.com/en/blog/interior-design-style/309-design-history-ancient-greece-part4-domestic-buildings-and-greek-furnishings.html#:~:text=Internal%20decorations%20in%20the%20classical,red%20with%20yellow%20and%20white" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SOURCE</a> </p>
            
        <h2>Ancient Rome</h2>
        <p>In ancient roman interior design, some styles and designs that were mainly focused on were <strong>Neoclassical home decor</strong>, <strong>Stucco wall decor</strong> and<strong> Mosaics</strong>. Other design aspects included sculptures, bronze work, bold colors, and arches and vaults.  When applying the Neoclassical home decor, this included alot of “elegance, lightness of touch, and sophisticatioin.” When we go and look at the colors they used, you will see alot of richer color schemes that consist of combinations such as black and red, white and black and blue and purple. While looking at Stucco wall decor, you will see that these popular paintings were three dimensional artworked formed into their walls. As Mosaics were also favored in this era, these mostly consisted of colorful tile designs that would generally be created on floors, walls, or ceilings.  As design and arichtecure was very popular in ancient times, it has influenced many modern designs today. <a href="https://thelocalflea.com/a/blog/roman-home-decor-style-guide#:~:text=Romans%20adorned%20their%20homes%20with,modern%20styles%20throughout%20the%20ages" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SOURCE</a></p>

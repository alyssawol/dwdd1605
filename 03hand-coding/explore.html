        <h1>Explore Differnt Styles</h1>
        <p>There are many different styles and architecture when it comes to interior design. </p>
        <p>some of the most common ones are: </p>
        <dl>
           <dt><strong>Minimalist</strong></dt>
           <dd> This style would be seen as the most simplistic of all interior design styles. Some factors that this will focus on and enhance are clean lines, tidyness, uncluttered, and monochromatic. As <em>Lilian H. Weinreich</em> said “Minimalist architecture involves the use of reductive design elements, without ornamentation or decoration”</dd>
           <dt><strong>Contemperary</strong></dt>
           <dd> This style is considered to be the most futuristic as it implies the current trends and changes into it. While the colors are often kept neutral, this style would fit right between modern and minimalistic design. It is meant to be appealing to the eye as its asethitics play a big part in its style.</dd>
           <dt><strong>Traditional</strong></dt>
           <dd> This style is often referred to as classical and <strong>timeless</strong>. This style was actually founded in Europe around the 18-19th century and has remained popular ever since. Some key factors embraced into this type of design are its older style of design, symmetry focused, wood finishes and neutral color pallets with a slight use of boldness. </dd>
           <dt><strong>Rustic</strong></dt>
           <dd> this style is seen as an organic form of interior design. Its materials tend to emphazie the outside as materials and objects such as woods, clay, stone and greens are used plenty. When compared to the other styles, this is seen as the complete opposite of modern or contemporary design.</dd>
           <dt><strong>Bohemian</strong></dt>
           <dd> bohemian or boho design is creative and free-spririted style that allows you to express yourself through artwork and decoration. Something special about this type of style is that there are no rules to creating this type of design. Although, most people use an arrangement of colors, shapes, and visuals to create a space of their liking.</dd>
